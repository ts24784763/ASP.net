images.rar and assets.rar should be decompressed.

This work was my final project for the ASP.NET course that I took in my sophomore year. At that time, I wanted to organize a sports event, so I attempted to set up a website to provide participants information.

The general functions are as follows:

  1. Competition rules for various types of sports: The homepage provides participants with registration information, competition times, and other details for various types of sports competitions.

  2. Review of photos from past events: By using the classification buttons above the photo albums for different types of sports, users can quickly filter out photos from other sports, and clicking on the photos will enlarge them for viewing.

  3. Registration form: Provides a link to the registration form.

  4. View the list of registered teams: Through connection with the database, users can view the registration status for various types of sports competitions.
